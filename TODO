* Infrastructure

** Make lowlevel API platform agnostic

- fundamentally, all we need is key = value
 - and way to iterate ranges of those

** Move from own stuff + make to cmake + sput + libubox

.. writing own data structures is not probably sensible in the long run ..

* Core features

** define basic API

** implement basic API

*** write unit tests for basic API in C

- mostly to be able to use e.g. valgrind, coverage, and other tools to make
  sure that we cover the API

** write SWIG definitions for the API

*** write test code in some sensible language for the API

* Fun feature ideas

** Should capture data from Withings?

- I'd rather NOT have Withings own my data => capture scale traffic on home
  edge and store them in kvdb instead


* Legalese

** Get rid of GPL code if any, and prune the git of it before release of any sort
