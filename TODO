* Infrastructure

** Make lowlevel API platform agnostic

- fundamentally, all we need is key = value
 - and way to iterate ranges of those

* Core features

** define basic API

*** log import/export

*** 'rewind' feature

- migrate current state backwards in time by replaying the log in reverse
  order

=> need 'old + new' value fields to log for it to be even moderately efficient?

- can make it per-object / per-app to make it faster?

**** plan B: just provide access to log?

- somewhat less neat, but if you already know objects you care about, you
  can just look at their history

** implement basic API

*** write unit tests for basic API in C

- mostly to be able to use e.g. valgrind, coverage, and other tools to make
  sure that we cover the API

** write SWIG definitions for the API

*** write test code in some sensible language for the API

* Fun feature ideas

** Should capture data from Withings?

- I'd rather NOT have Withings own my data => capture scale traffic on home
  edge and store them in kvdb instead

* Random small features

** make double encoding endianness-safe (does it really matter?)

** use Google protocol buffer-style zigzag encoding for int64

(does it really matter if we compress data in any case? zeros compress
well..)
