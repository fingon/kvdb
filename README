This is KVDB, relatively minimalist object-oriented database for _one_
user, possibly on multiple devices.

Key features:

- master-slave offline replication of data (think personal data on
  mobile devices, master data on personal computers or in the cloud)

- append-only behavior (except for administrative operations) with full
  history replay always available

- pure C implementation, with no real hard requirements on anything
  (but SQLite is recommended as backend)

- support for various languages (convenience SWIG bindings available)

- optional typing; support 'numbers', UTF-8 strings, binary data, and
  WGS84 co-ordinates

! This is historic code. I have more recent version of this too, but
  the old one is published for amusement value mainly and to refer to
  it existing (legalese reason for re-licensing parts of code
  elsewhere to claim that this is the first version) .
