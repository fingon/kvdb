* Current

** Per object

x2 ptr - prev, next (in attr list)
ptr - backpointer to kvdb
2x ptr - app, cl (in stringset)
oid (16 bytes)

= 5 ptr + 16 bytes = ~56 bytes on 64bit platform

** Per field

2x ptr - prev, next
ptr - key (in stringset)
17-20 bytes - type+value

3 ptr + 20 bytes = 44 bytes

* Optimal (typed)

** Per object

ptr - to type object (has app, cl, kvdb backpointers + info about fields)
16 bytes - oid

= 24 bytes in 64bit platform (~half)

** Per field

.. fields packed after the object, based o type object info about fields;
no need to store anything else than value

~value (8+ bytes each)

= 8 bytes or more each
